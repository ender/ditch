# ditch (archived)
Simple Discord bot created using an advanced handler from [MenuDocs](https://github.com/MenuDocs/discord.js-template) and modified (albeit slightly) for Discord.JS v13. **This project is dead but may contain useful code for *someone*.**

# note
If for some reason someone wants to fork this outdated, insignificant, and irrelevant project, then [this line](https://github.com/ender/ditch/blob/8422976ff1c21408f3691cc5e3c97699e1560a7a/src/Structures/Util.js#L121) and [this line](https://github.com/ender/ditch/blob/8422976ff1c21408f3691cc5e3c97699e1560a7a/src/Structures/Util.js#L140) must be modified for use between Linux and/or Windows as directory scrubbing may work different between these two operating systems. The same might have to be done for other functions that access system files.
